While we appreciate the Ministry's objective to enhance the ease of doing business in the IFSC, we believe the current draft presents significant prudential and systemic risks that must be addressed. Our concerns are threefold: First, the principle of 'Risk Parity' is violated. The amendment treats RBI-regulated NBFCs and IFSCA-regulated Finance Companies as equivalent, but their underlying supervisory and capital adequacy norms are not harmonized. Granting the same exemptions without ensuring the same level of regulatory rigor creates a significant supervisory gap. Second, the broad definition of 'lending activities' in the proposed Rule 11(2)(b) could inadvertently include high-risk, speculative financial products that fall outside the scope of traditional lending, thereby amplifying systemic risk. Third, the lack of a clear, periodic review mechanism for this exemption is a major oversight. Economic conditions and risk profiles change, and a permanent exemption could become problematic in the future. Therefore, we strongly recommend that the Ministry defers this notification and establishes a joint committee with the RBI and IFSCA to first harmonize the prudential norms for these entities before considering any exemptions. Furthermore, we suggest that any exemption granted should be subject to a mandatory review every three years.","DocumentID":"Public-Notice-June-2025","SectionID":"Document Level","CommentCategory":"Suggest modification in the chapter/section","UserName":"Arun Kumar","UserRole":"Director/Designated Partner","OrganizationName":"Indian Banks' Association","single_value":"Negative","multi_value":"{\"Risk\": \"Negative\", \"Supervision\": \"Negative\", \"Legal Ambiguity\": \"Negative\"}","suggestion":true},
